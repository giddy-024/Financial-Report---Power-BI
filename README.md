## Introduction and Business Problem
This is dataset of a company to determine the financial performance of their businesses in different part of the Globe. The manager wants to see a report on your latest sale figures. They have requested an executive summary of the following:
•	What is the Total profit and gross Sales?
•	What is the % Profit?
•	What is the profit for Canada, France, and Germany?
•	Which month and year had the most profit?
•	Where is the company seeing the most success (by country)?
•	Which product and segment should the company continue to invest in?
•	Give reasons why the company should continue to invest in that segment and product mentioned above?

## Data Wrangling
Our data was imported to Power query editor which serve as a stage for data preparation and cleaning. The data goes through the cleaning processes to remove missing values and duplicates which enhances quality and integrity of our data. Data types mismatched were rectified to their correct format which aid in making accurate analysis. The data was now cleaned and ready for exploration and further analysis.
 
## Analysis and Findings
The company's financial report for the fiscal year 2013/2014 showed a total profit of £16.89 million and gross sales of £127.93 million. The profit margin was 16.59%, indicating that the business generated £0.17 in profit for every dollar of sales, which suggests a healthy financial performance.
The company operates in Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, and the United States. Among these regions, France had the highest profit, followed by Germany and Canada with £3.7 million, £3.6 million, and £3.5 million, respectively. The United States and Mexico had the lowest profits of £2.99 million and £2.90 million, respectively, due to significant losses incurred in the enterprise segment, which substantially reduced their overall profits.
In terms of monthly performance, the company experienced its highest profits in October for 2013/2014, with the highest profit recorded in October 2013. This peak in October was primarily driven by substantial profits across all products, and in the government segment. Additionally, the company's overall profit in 2014 was $13.02 million, significantly higher than the $3.88 million profit in 2013. However, it's important to note that data for the 1st and 2nd quarters of 2013 were unavailable, which could potentially explain the substantial difference in profits between the two years.


## Recommendations
Based on the financial data, the company should continue to prioritize investments in the Government sector, which contributed the highest gross sales of £56.4 million (44% of gross sales). The Small Business sector should also remain a focal point, as it generated the second-highest gross sales of £45.94 million (36% of gross sales).
Despite having one of the lowest gross sales figures at £1.5 million (2% of gross sales), the Channel Partners sector contributed a substantial profit of £1.32 million. In contrast, the Enterprise Partners sector, with gross sales of £21 million (16% of gross sales), reported a significant loss of £614,546.
The Government and Small Business sectors collectively accounted for a substantial portion of the company's total profit, contributing £11.39 million (65%) and £4.14 million (24%), respectively. Given their profitability, it is recommended that the company maintains investments across all products, as they generate sufficient profits without incurring losses.
However, particular emphasis should be placed on investing in the Paseo, VTT, Amarilla, and Velo products, as they have demonstrated strong performance and potential for further growth.
In summary, the company should continue to invest in the Government and Small Business sectors, maintain investments across all profitable products, and prioritize investments in the Paseo, VTT, Amarilla, and Velo products to sustain and enhance its financial performance.
